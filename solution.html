<h2> -Solutions to Overpopulation
To reduce the effects of overpopulation, overpopulation remedies are required. A country's rapid development will result in significant population expansion. Education, contraceptive access, and policy will all aid in population control in these countries.</h2>
<h3>Here are the best Examples </h3>
<ul>

<li>Better Sex Education 
In many countries, a lack of sex education – or a poorly executed education – has resulted in overpopulation problems. The problem is so severe that the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is urging reforms, particularly in the world's poorest regions.

People will gain a better understanding of the potential repercussions of having sex in relation to childbirth with better education. It will also dispel many of the myths surrounding sexuality and introduce scientifically proven birth control methods.</li>

<li>Access to Contraceptives

Better sex education and access to birth control must go side in tandem. People can't put what they've learnt into practice if they don't have it.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 225 million women in underdeveloped nations would prefer to delay having children but do not use any type of contraception. Many groups, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), promote expanding contraception access.</li>
<td><img src="policy.jpg" title="Understandable" alt="Policies" width="350" height="200"/></td>
<li>Changes in Policies
Many countries compensate those who have more children, whether in the form of financial incentives or enhanced benefits. This may lead to some couples having more children than they would otherwise if they were concerned about the financial implications.

This is a challenging problem to address. Because of the limits it imposed on freedom, China's "One-Child" policy was recently abandoned, and comparable regulations are likely to be considered as equally oppressive.</li>
